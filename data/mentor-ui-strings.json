    "fullDescription": "Mentors exist to help you understand your character — not to control them. When you speak with a mentor, they reflect your choices back to you: how your abilities, talents, and actions are shaping who you are becoming. Different mentors value different things, so the same character may be seen very differently depending on who you ask. Talking to a mentor never costs anything and never forces a decision. You aren't being told what to do — you're being shown how your character currently appears, and what paths that suggest. What you do with that insight is always up to you.",
