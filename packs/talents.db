You must spend a Force Point when you activate the Force Power to do this, and the area you target is based on the size of the object: Large, 2x2; Huge, 3x3; Gargantuan, 4x4; Colossal and larger, 6x6. When you use Move Object to make an Area Attack with the object you are moving, you compare your Use the Force check to the Reflex Defense of each creature, Droid, and Vehicle in the target area. If your check equals or exceeds the target's Reflex Defense, it takes damage from the object (as determined by the Move Object Force Power). Otherwise, the target takes half damage.

You can use the Repair application of the Mechanics skill to Repair Droid or Repair Object as a Standard Action. You can gain the benefits of this Talent only once per day per Droid, object, or Vehicle Repaired. As a Swift Action, you can sabotage any object or weapon that is powered by an Energy Cell or Power Pack so that it becomes a Grenade. The object or Weapon is then considered to be a Frag Grenade in all ways, but it can be turned back into its original form with another Swift Action. As a Standard Action, you can increase the speed of one adjacent Droid or Vehicle that you occupy by 1 square (applied to any method of Locomotion) until the end of your next turn. Any Droid or Vehicle can only benefit from this Talent once per round.

Allies can spend this Move Action to instead reroll their Initiative checks and take the better of the two results as a Free Action before combat begins. You deliver a scathing rebuke against a target to erode its will and fill it with doubt. Make a Persuasion check as a Standard Action against the target's Will Defense. If successful, you impose a -2 penalty to all the target's Defenses until the end of your next turn. You can use this ability only against targets that can clearly hear and understand your language. Once per encounter, as a Standard Action, you can grant a tactical advantage to all allies within your line of sight.

Allies lose this benefit immediately if line of sight is broken or if you are unconscious or dead, or at the end of the encounter.

In the case of a Vehicle or Droid, you are able to operate any single Vehicle or Droid system as if you were at the appropriate station, but at a +5 bonus to the associated check (attack roll or Skill Check). Further, when a merged Force-user uses the Reroute Power Action, their Vehicle moves an additional +1 step up the Condition Track. Upon returning to their natural body, a Force-user suffers a -5 penalty to all Use the Force checks made for 1d4 hours for every round they spent merged, and cannot spend Force Points unless accepting a Dark Side Point. If the player was merged for longer than an hour, they suffer a -10 penalty to all Use the Force checks for 1d4 days for every hour spent merged, and cannot spend Force Points or Destiny Points unless accepting a Dark Side Point.

If you are entitled to a Deception check reroll, you may reroll your Use the Force check instead (subject to the same circumstances and limitations). Prerequisites: , Dark Side Master Your knowledge of Sith sorcery allows you to imbue talismans and other objects with the power of the Dark Side. Create Sith Talisman: You can spend one Force Point to imbue a portable object with the Dark Side, creating a Sith Talisman that provides offensive strength to a Force Power or Lightsaber attack. Creating the talisman takes a Full-Round Action. While you wear or carry a Sith Talisman on your person, add 1d6 to damage rolls with your Force Powers. You increase your Dark Side Score by one when you first put on or carry a Sith Talisman. You can only have one Sith Talisman active at any given time, and if it is destroyed, you cannot create another one for 24 hours. Create Sith Weapon: You can alchemically treat a properly prepared weapon to become a Sith Weapon. You may spend a Force Point to imbue the weapon with the properties of the Sith Alchemical Weapon Template (this process takes one hour to complete).

Homebrew Reference Book: Legacy of the Force Sourcebook Prerequisites: , Dark Side Master Once per encounter, you can spend a Force Point as a Standard Action to call upon the vengeful spirits of the ancient Sith. Doing so grants you 3 Followers with the Vengeful Spirit Template.
