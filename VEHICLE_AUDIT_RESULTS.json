    "Vehicles marked REVIEW_REQUIRED are mostly generic 'Vehicle' type entries without descriptions",
    "6 gunships flagged (ambiguous between airspeeder/transport)",
    "Named ships without lore context (e.g., The Ebon Hawk, Millennium Falcon) require manual classification",
    "Mapped vehicles use canonical categories: mount, speeder, tracked, walker, wheeled, emplacement, airspeeder, starfighter, transport, capitalShip, spaceStation",
    "All starfighter-class and transport-class entries properly identified",
    "All known Star Destroyers and cruisers correctly mapped to capitalShip"
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Review 148 REVIEW_REQUIRED vehicles manually",
    "Update compendium entries with proper type/description data",
    "Lock canonical mapping into VEHICLE_CATEGORY_REGISTRY",
    "Implement preCreate hook for category auto-fill",
    "Add category-based sheet filtering"
