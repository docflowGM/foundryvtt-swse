# Mentor System Guide

## What Mentors Do

Mentors exist to help you understand your character — not to control them.

When you speak with a mentor, they reflect your choices back to you: how your abilities, talents, and actions are shaping who you are becoming. Different mentors value different things, so the same character may be seen very differently depending on who you ask.

**Talking to a mentor never costs anything and never forces a decision.** You aren't being told what to do — you're being shown how your character currently appears, and what paths that suggest. What you do with that insight is always up to you.

## How Mentors Work

### You Unlock Mentors Through Your Classes

Each class gives you access to a specific mentor:
- **Jedi** → Miraj (philosophical, Force-focused)
- **Soldier** → Breach (pragmatic, combat-focused)
- **Scout** → Lead (tactical, pattern-focused)
- **Scoundrel** → Ol' Salty (irreverent, survival-focused)
- **Noble** → J0-N1 (analytical, system-focused)

### Mentors See Your Character Differently

All mentors have access to the same facts about your character. But they interpret those facts through their own philosophy.

**Example: A Level 5 Guardian**

- **Miraj:** "You've proven your connection. The Force flows through your choices."
- **Breach:** "You've proven yourself in the field. Your record speaks volumes."
- **Lead:** "The patterns are obvious to you now, and you're shaping up as a Guardian."
- **Ol' Salty:** "Ye've cheated death more'n once, and you're becoming a legend."
- **J0-N1:** "Performance parameters exceed baseline. Efficiency gains are measurable."

Same character. Five different perspectives.

### The 8 Dialogue Topics

When you talk to a mentor, you can choose from these topics:

1. **Who am I becoming?** — Understand how mentors see your character's identity
2. **What paths are open to me?** — Explore the different specializations available in your class
3. **What am I doing well?** — Get affirmation on effective choices and synergies
4. **What am I doing wrong?** — Identify gaps, inefficiencies, or vulnerabilities
5. **How should I fight?** — Learn your role in combat and battlefield priorities
6. **What should I be careful of?** — Understand risks and potential traps
7. **What lies ahead?** — Explore prestige classes and long-term paths
8. **How would you play this class?** — See your mentor's personal philosophy and priorities

## Why Mentors Matter

### They're Mirrors, Not Guides

Mentors don't tell you what to do. They show you what your character looks like *right now*, filtered through their perspective.

Think of it as getting five different character portraits of the same person.

### They Respect Your Authority

- You choose which mentor to listen to
- You decide what to do with their perspective
- Nothing is locked, nothing is required
- You can change your build at any time (within the game's normal rules)

### They Make Your Choices Feel Meaningful

When a mentor acknowledges a synergy you built ("Your Strength and combat training reinforce each other perfectly"), it validates your building decisions.

When a mentor points out a gap ("You're neglecting Constitution — that makes you fragile"), it gives context to future choices.

## How to Use Mentors

### For New Characters

If you're building a new character and unsure about your path:
- Talk to "Who am I becoming?" to see how mentors read your current build
- Talk to "What paths are open?" to understand your class options
- Talk to "How would you play this class?" to get inspired by each mentor's philosophy

### For Leveling Up

When you gain a level:
- Talk to "What am I doing well?" for encouragement
- Talk to "What am I doing wrong?" to identify problems before they compound
- Talk to "What lies ahead?" to plan your next moves

### For Troubleshooting

If your character feels weak or unfocused:
- Talk to "How should I fight?" to clarify your role
- Talk to "What should I be careful of?" to identify traps
- Talk to "What am I doing wrong?" to find specific problems

### For Roleplay

Mentors can inspire character voice and personality:
- Listen to how different mentors describe your character
- Notice which mentor's philosophy aligns with your character concept
- Use mentor perspectives to inform how you play

## Common Questions

**Q: Do mentors ever give bad advice?**

A: Mentors don't give advice — they give perspective. If a mentor's perspective doesn't help you, talk to another mentor. Different viewpoints serve different purposes.

**Q: Can I switch mentors?**

A: You can always talk to any mentor unlocked by your classes. Your character isn't "locked" to a mentor's philosophy.

**Q: What if I don't like what a mentor says?**

A: Then ignore it. Mentors are mirrors, not masters. You're in control.

**Q: Can mentors force me to respec my build?**

A: No. Mentors never lock or restrict your choices. They're purely reflective.

**Q: Do some mentors conflict with each other?**

A: Yes — intentionally. Different mentors have different values, so they'll sometimes disagree on what's "good." That tension is the point.

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of Mentors

### Talk to Multiple Mentors on the Same Topic

You'll notice how each mentor prioritizes differently. This teaches you about your own character's strengths from multiple angles.

### Pay Attention to What Mentors DON'T Say

Sometimes silence is louder than words. If a mentor doesn't mention a particular stat or skill, it might not align with their priorities — which tells you something.

### Use Mentors to Understand Your Actual Build

Mentors are honest. If they're noticing problems, those problems are real. If they're celebrating synergies, those synergies are genuine.

### Experiment with Different Mentors for Different Situations

- Ask Breach for tactical clarity
- Ask Miraj for philosophical grounding
- Ask Lead for practical assessment
- Ask Ol' Salty for creative solutions
- Ask J0-N1 for systematic analysis

Each brings something different to the table.

## Final Word

Mentors are here to make your character feel seen and understood. They're not gatekeepers or judges. They're your character's reflection in five different mirrors.

Use them as much or as little as you like. The choice is always yours.
