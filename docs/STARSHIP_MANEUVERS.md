# Starship Maneuvers

**Reference Book**: Star Wars Saga Edition Starships of the Galaxy

**See also**: [Starship Combat](VEHICLE_COMBAT.md), Fleet Maneuvers, Starship Maneuvers and Crew Quality

## Overview

The Starship Maneuvers system provides new options for any character acting as a Pilot or Gunner during a Starship Scale encounter. Similar to the system for using Force Powers, the Starship Maneuvers system allows characters to perform incredible stunts or make use of advanced tactics in order to gain the upper hand in Starship Scale combat.

**Important Restriction**: Except for Starship Maneuvers used by Gunners, only Pilots of Starfighters and Airspeeders may make use of the mechanics in this section. Capital Ships and Space Transports are too large and cumbersome. However, the Combat Thrusters Starship Modification may be used on Space Transports to circumvent this restriction.

A Starship Maneuver is a special action that allows a Pilot or Gunner to do something beyond the bounds of the Pilot skill and the abilities provided by the Ace Pilot Prestige Class. Starship Maneuvers enhance attacks, strengthen defenses, reduce damage, or produce other unique effects.

## Using Starship Maneuvers in Your Game

Adding the Starship Maneuvers system to your game can greatly change it, so Gamemasters should feel free to allow or disallow this system as fits their campaign. Taking the Starship Tactics Feat consumes a valuable Feat slot, so players should likely do so only if the campaign features a good amount of space or Airspeeder combat.

**Rule of Thumb**: If the player won't have a chance to use any of these Starship Maneuvers at least once per adventure, the Gamemaster should seriously consider whether to allow the Starship Maneuvers system in the game.

## Learning Starship Maneuvers

A character who takes the **Starship Tactics Feat** automatically learns a number of Starship Maneuvers equal to **1 + their Wisdom modifier** (minimum of 1). A character can learn additional Starship Maneuvers by:
- Taking the Starship Tactics Feat again
- Increasing their Wisdom modifier

### Learning Example

Syal Antilles is a 5th-level Soldier with a Wisdom score of 13 (+1 modifier).

- **At 6th level**: She takes the Starship Tactics Feat and immediately gains two Starship Maneuvers. She chooses **Attack Pattern Delta** and **Corellian Slip**.
- **At 8th level**: She raises her Wisdom score from 13 to 14, increasing her ability modifier from +1 to +2; she gains an additional Starship Maneuver and chooses **Target Lock**.
- **At 9th level**: She selects the Starship Tactics Feat again, granting her three new Starship Maneuvers. She chooses **Tallon Roll**, **Angle Deflector Shields**, and a second use of **Corellian Slip**.

## Using Starship Maneuvers

When your character uses a Starship Maneuver, make a **Pilot check**. The check result determines the Starship Maneuver's result.

### Resolution Rules

- Most Starship Maneuvers have varying degrees of success
- Some Starship Maneuvers (including all with the **[Attack Pattern]** descriptor) have an all-or-nothing effect
- For maneuvers with multi-tiered effects, your check result determines the maximum effect you can achieve
- You can choose a lesser effect even if you could achieve a better one
- If your check result is too low to activate the Starship Maneuver's most basic effect, nothing happens, the Starship Maneuver is spent, and the Action is wasted

## Your Starship Maneuver Suite

Your character's Starship Maneuvers collectively form a **suite**. When your character uses a Starship Maneuver, that Starship Maneuver is **spent** and is no longer available for use until it is recovered. You may have multiple uses of the same Starship Maneuver in your Starship Maneuver Suite.

## Regaining Starship Maneuvers

You have different ways to regain spent Starship Maneuvers, making them available for use once more:

1. **Rest**: When a Starship Combat sequence is over and you have a chance to rest for 1 minute, you regain all Starship Maneuvers.
2. **Natural 20**: If you roll a Natural 20 on a Pilot check made to activate a Starship Maneuver (but not for any other uses of the Pilot skill), you regain all spent Starship Maneuvers at the end of your turn.
3. **Force Point**: You can spend a Force Point as a Reaction and immediately regain one spent Starship Maneuver.
4. **Unique Abilities**: Some unique abilities allow you to regain spent Starship Maneuvers in other ways.

## Starship Maneuver Descriptors

Some Starship Maneuvers fall into special categories that affect how they are used and who can use them.

### [Attack Pattern]

Starship Maneuvers that have the **[Attack Pattern]** descriptor represent formations and flying patterns that form an overall Starship Combat strategy.

- Once activated, effects last until the end of the encounter
- You may gain the benefit from only one Attack Pattern Starship Maneuver at a time
- If you activate an Attack Pattern Starship Maneuver while already gaining the benefits of another, the second Starship Maneuver replaces the effects of the first

### [Dogfight]

Starship Maneuvers that have the **[Dogfight]** descriptor represent tactics and actions that apply only in close combat situations.

- A Dogfight Starship Maneuver may only be activated while your ship is engaged in a Dogfight with another Starship or group of Starships

### [Force]

A Starship Maneuver that has the **[Force]** descriptor is one that relies on the user's connection to The Force for its benefit.

- Only characters who are Trained in the Use the Force skill may make use of Force Starship Maneuvers
- Activating a Force Starship Maneuver is considered using The Force

### [Gunner]

A Starship Maneuver that has the **[Gunner]** descriptor does not require you to be the Pilot of the ship in order to activate.

- Any Gunner Starship Maneuvers may be activated by either the Pilot or Copilot (using Pilot or Copilot-controlled Weapon Systems) or by a character serving as a Gunner aboard a Starship or Airspeeder

| **Attack Pattern Delta** | Attack Pattern | Swift Action | This Attack Pattern utilizes close-range maneuvering by allied ships to make it more difficult to target and hit an individual vessel.

| **Explosive Shot** | Gunner | Reaction | You target critical ship systems and fuel cells, causing your target to explode with incredible force. |
| **Howlrunner Formation** | Attack Pattern | Swift Action | This Attack Pattern divides an attacking force into two or more groups, making it easier to attack an enemy's flanks. |
| **I Have You Now** | N/A | Swift Action | This maneuver allows a ship to close in on its target, striking from short range with devastating effect. |
| **Intercept** | N/A | Reaction | This maneuver allows a ship to fire thrusters and intercept a passing target, engaging in a Dogfight. |
| **Overwhelming Assault** | Attack Pattern | Swift Action | Starships that use an Overwhelming Assault Attack Pattern concentrate their fire on a single target to the exclusion of all others. |

| **Skim the Surface** | N/A | Full-Round Action | This maneuver allows a Starship to get down beneath a larger ship's shields, dealing damage that bypasses shields and directly impacts on the hull. |
| **Skywalker Loop** | Dogfight | Reaction | This maneuver allows a Pilot to loop a Vehicle through the same location it just left, launching a surprise attack on an unsuspecting opponent. |
| **Snap Roll** | N/A | Reaction | This maneuver lets a Pilot peel his or her Vehicle away from its current location with incredible speed, causing attackers to fire at where it was just moments ago. |
| **Strike Formation** | Attack Pattern | Swift Action | Pilots who use a Strike Formation Attack Pattern devote themselves to overwhelming an enemy with damage rather than concerning themselves with their own defense. |
| **Tallon Roll** | Dogfight | Reaction | This maneuver allows a pursuing Starfighter to stay with a maneuvering opponent even when its target is attempting to escape. |
| **Target Lock** | Dogfight | Standard Action | This maneuver allows a Pilot to focus on single target, lining up a shot with careful precision. |
| **Target Sense** | Force | Swift Action | This maneuver allows a Force-sensitive Pilot to target opponents without the use of a Vehicle's targeting computer. |
| **Thruster Hit** | Gunner | Reaction | This maneuver allows you to target an opponent's maneuvering thrusters, reducing the maneuverability they provide to a ship. |
| **Wotan Weave** | N/A | Swift Action | This maneuver allows the ship to fly in a corkscrew, moving forward as normal but making the ship difficult to hit. |
