/* ============================================================================
   SWSE — CORE OVERRIDES
   Intentional Foundry Core UI overrides.
   These selectors target Foundry's own UI regions (#sidebar, #controls, etc.)
   and must not be moved into the SWSE namespace.

   Rules here are explicitly reviewed and safe for Foundry v13 AppV2.
   ============================================================================ */

/* PHASE 4 — Mask rules removed.
   Foundry v13 manages sidebar icon rendering natively via --control-icon.
   Mask overrides here were competing with Foundry's own icon system.
   Reverted to Foundry default control icon behavior.
   If sidebar icons break, investigate JS-side icon registration first. */
