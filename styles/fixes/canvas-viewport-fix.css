   Canvas Viewport Fix

   NOTE: Global html/body rules REMOVED - they were breaking Foundry's
   native layout by setting overflow:visible which allows unwanted
   scrolling and breaks the fixed viewport positioning.

   Foundry VTT handles its own viewport management. Do not override
   html, body, or #board with global rules.
   ================================================================ */

/*
 * If specific SWSE application windows need viewport fixes,
 * namespace them properly:
 *
 * .swse-app-app .some-element {
 *     ... safe rules here ...
 * }
