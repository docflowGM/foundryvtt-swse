## CRITICAL BUGS (FIXED) 🔴

### Bug #1: Missing Cost/Weight Formulas in droid-systems.js
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Runtime Error
**Location:** `/scripts/data/droid-systems.js` (entire file)
**Files Affected:**
- `/scripts/apps/chargen/chargen-droid.js:169, 170, 204-209, 244-248, 296-300`

**Problem:**
The droid-systems.js file defined locomotion, processor, and appendage systems WITHOUT the required cost and weight calculation functions. The chargen-droid.js code called these formulas:
- `loco.costFormula(speed, costFactor)` — returned undefined
- `loco.weightFormula(costFactor)` — returned undefined
- `proc.costFormula(costFactor)` — returned undefined
- `app.costFormula(costFactor)` — returned undefined

**Impact:** The droid builder UI would crash with "TypeError: X is not a function" when displaying systems.

**Fix Applied:**
✅ Added `costFormula` and `weightFormula` functions to all locomotion systems
✅ Added cost/weight properties to all processor systems
✅ Added cost/weight properties to all appendage systems
✅ Created complete `accessories` object with 5 categories (armor, communications, sensors, shields, translators, miscellaneous)

**Cost Formula Details:**
```javascript
// Locomotion examples (speed-based)
walking: (speed, costFactor) => Math.ceil(speed * 10 * costFactor)
wheeled: (speed, costFactor) => Math.ceil(speed * 15 * costFactor)
flying: (speed, costFactor) => Math.ceil(speed * 25 * costFactor)

// Processor examples
basic: cost: 100, weight: 3
heuristic: cost: 0, weight: 5 (FREE)
remote: costFormula: (cf) => 200 * cf, weight: 2

// Appendage examples
probe: cost: 50, weight: 0.5
hand: cost: 200, weight: 1.5
claw: cost: 150, weight: 1.5
```

### Bug #2: Missing Accessories Object in droid-systems.js
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Silent Failure
**Location:** `/scripts/data/droid-systems.js` (entirely missing)
**Files Affected:**
- `/scripts/apps/chargen/chargen-droid.js:276-281` (populating accessories)
- `/scripts/apps/chargen/chargen-droid.js:302, 444` (finding accessories)

**Problem:**
Code referenced `DROID_SYSTEMS.accessories.armor`, `.communications`, `.sensors`, `.shields`, `.translators`, `.miscellaneous` but the accessories object didn't exist. This caused:
- Silent failures in `_populateAccessoryCategory()`
- Accessory tabs would display as empty
- No accessories could be added to droids

**Impact:** Accessory system was completely non-functional.

**Fix Applied:**
✅ Created full `accessories` object with:
- **armor**: Light, Medium, Heavy plating options
- **communications**: Basic comlink, Encrypted comlink, Hologram projector
- **sensors**: Basic, Enhanced, Scanner array
- **shields**: Light, Medium, Heavy shield generators
- **translators**: Basic, Advanced, Universal translators
- **miscellaneous**: Manipulator arm, Repulsor lift, Battery backup, Self-repair kit

### Bug #3: Size Array Missing "colossal" in swse-droid-handler.js
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Size Validation Failure
**Location:** `/scripts/actors/droid/swse-droid-handler.js:266`

**Problem:**
The size order validation array was:
```javascript
const order = ["tiny", "small", "medium", "large", "huge", "gargantuan"];
```

But chargen-droid.js defined "colossal" as a valid size (line 63). When a colossal droid tried to install shields or hardened systems, the size check would fail:
```javascript
order.indexOf("colossal") = -1  // Not found!
order.indexOf("large") = 3
// -1 >= 3 = false (incorrectly rejects)
```

**Impact:** Colossal droids couldn't install any size-restricted systems.

**Fix Applied:**
✅ Added "colossal" to the size order array:
```javascript
const order = ["tiny", "small", "medium", "large", "huge", "gargantuan", "colossal"];
```

## HIGH PRIORITY BUGS (FIXED) 🟠

### Bug #4: Hardcoded Processor Weight on Removal
**Severity:** HIGH - Inconsistent Data
**Location:** `/scripts/apps/chargen/chargen-droid.js:495` (old code)

**Problem:**
When a player removed a processor and fell back to the free Heuristic, the code hardcoded the weight:
```javascript
this.characterData.droidSystems.processor = {
  name: "Heuristic Processor",
  id: "heuristic",
  cost: 0,
  weight: 5  // Hardcoded!
};
```

If the actual Heuristic processor data changed (e.g., weight updated to 4 or 6), this fallback would be out of sync, causing incorrect total weight calculations.

**Impact:** Total droid weight could be inaccurate after processor removal.

**Fix Applied:**
✅ Look up Heuristic from DROID_SYSTEMS.processors:
```javascript
const heuristic = DROID_SYSTEMS.processors.find(p => p.id === 'heuristic');
this.characterData.droidSystems.processor = {
  name: heuristic?.name || "Heuristic Processor",
  id: "heuristic",
  cost: 0,
  weight: heuristic?.weight || 5
};
```

### Bug #5: Hand Free Item Logic Flawed
**Severity:** HIGH - Credit Calculation Error
**Location:** `/scripts/apps/chargen/chargen-droid.js:431-432` (old), line 251

**Problem:**
The logic for determining if a hand is free checked total hand count:
```javascript
const handCount = this.characterData.droidSystems.appendages
  .filter(a => a.id === 'hand').length;
const actualCost = (id === 'hand' && handCount < 2) ? 0 : cost;
```

This failed when users manipulated hands in certain orders:
1. Add hand #1 (cost: 0)
2. Add hand #2 (cost: 0)
3. Remove hand #1 (still has 1 hand, shouldn't affect free status)
4. Add hand #3 (cost: should be paid, but might be marked free)

**Impact:** Incorrect credit tracking and total cost calculations.

**Fix Applied:**
✅ Track free hands by cost, not by count:
```javascript
const freeHandCount = this.characterData.droidSystems.appendages
  .filter(a => a.id === 'hand' && a.cost === 0).length;
const actualCost = (id === 'hand' && freeHandCount < 2) ? 0 : cost;
```

Applied to both purchase (line 446) and display (line 265) logic.

### Bug #6: Incomplete Ability Setup for Imported Droids
**Severity:** HIGH - Data Inconsistency
**Location:** `/scripts/apps/chargen/chargen-droid.js:918-920`

**Problem:**
When importing a droid type, the code set CON to zero but didn't initialize all CON properties:
```javascript
this.characterData.abilities.con.base = 0;
this.characterData.abilities.con.total = 0;
this.characterData.abilities.con.mod = 0;
// Missing: .racial = 0 and .temp = 0
```

This could leave `.racial` and `.temp` undefined or with stale data, causing cascading issues in ability recalculation.

**Impact:** Imported droids could have inconsistent ability score state.

**Fix Applied:**
✅ Initialize all CON properties:
```javascript
this.characterData.abilities.con.base = 0;
this.characterData.abilities.con.racial = 0;
this.characterData.abilities.con.temp = 0;
this.characterData.abilities.con.total = 0;
this.characterData.abilities.con.mod = 0;
```

---

### Bug #7: Missing Default Processor Initialization
**Severity:** HIGH - UI/UX Issue
**Location:** `/scripts/apps/chargen/chargen-droid.js:122-144` (droid builder populate)

**Problem:**
The droid builder automatically initialized Walking as default locomotion, but never initialized a default processor. This meant:
- Players saw an empty processor field
- Validation would show "Droid must have processor" even though Heuristic is always free
- Confusing UX with apparent missing required system

**Impact:** Players confused about processor requirements; validation errors.

**Fix Applied:**
✅ Added default processor initialization after locomotion initialization:
```javascript
// Initialize default processor (Heuristic - free) if not already set
if (!this.characterData.droidSystems.processor) {
  const heuristicSystem = DROID_SYSTEMS.processors.find(p => p.id === "heuristic");
  if (heuristicSystem) {
    this.characterData.droidSystems.processor = {
      id: heuristicSystem.id,
      name: heuristicSystem.name,
      cost: 0,
      weight: heuristicSystem.weight || 5
    };
    // Don't add to spent credits - Heuristic is free
  }
}
```

### Bug #8: Dead Code Function
**Severity:** HIGH - Code Maintenance
**Location:** `/scripts/apps/chargen/chargen-droid.js:939-998` (removed)

**Problem:**
The function `_createImportedDroidActor()` (60 lines) existed but was never called anywhere:
```javascript
export async function _createImportedDroidActor(droid) {
  // ... 60 lines of unused code
}
```

This created:
- Maintenance confusion: is this used or deprecated?
- Dead code debt
- Duplicate logic with other droid creation code

**Impact:** Code maintenance burden.

**Fix Applied:**
✅ Removed entirely. If needed in the future, it can be recovered from git history.

## MEDIUM PRIORITY BUGS (FIXED) 🟡

### Bug #9: Inconsistent Droid Builder Credit Minimum
**Severity:** MEDIUM - UI Inconsistency
**Location:** `/scripts/apps/store/store-checkout.js:292` vs `/scripts/apps/chargen/chargen-droid.js:118`

**Problem:**
- **CharGen** used a settings value: `game.settings.get('foundryvtt-swse', "droidConstructionCredits") || 1000`
- **Store** hardcoded 1,000: `if (credits < 1000) { ui.notifications.warn("..."); }`

If a GM changed the setting, the store wouldn't reflect the change, showing incorrect credit requirements.

**Impact:** Confusing and inconsistent UI messaging.

**Fix Applied:**
✅ Updated store to use the same settings-based approach:
```javascript
const baseCredits = game.settings.get('foundryvtt-swse', "droidConstructionCredits") || 1000;
if (credits < baseCredits) {
    ui.notifications.warn(`You need at least ${baseCredits.toLocaleString()} credits...`);
}
```

✅ Updated dialog content to show dynamic value:
```javascript
<p><strong>Minimum cost:</strong> ${baseCredits.toLocaleString()} credits</p>
```

✅ Passed `droidConstructionCredits` to CharacterGenerator:
```javascript
const chargen = new CharacterGenerator(null, {
    droidBuilderMode: true,
    ownerActor: actor,
    droidLevel: actor.system.level || 1,
    availableCredits: credits,
    droidConstructionCredits: baseCredits
});
```

### Bug #10: Cart Count Logic Incorrect
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Display Logic
**Location:** `/scripts/apps/chargen/chargen-droid.js:610-628` (old)

**Problem:**
The cart count was confusing and mathematically wrong:
```javascript
let count = 0;
if (this.characterData.droidSystems.locomotion) count++;
const extraAppendages = this.characterData.droidSystems.appendages.length;
count += extraAppendages;
count += this.characterData.droidSystems.accessories.length;
const totalCount = count + 2; // "Add 2 for the free items"
```

Issues:
- Comment said "processor + 2 hands" but didn't account for free hands properly
- If a droid had 0 hands, it still added 2
- Processor wasn't counted in total
- "extra appendages" was a misleading variable name

**Impact:** Confusing and inaccurate cart item count display.

**Fix Applied:**
✅ Simplified to count all systems that are actually present:
```javascript
let count = 0;

// Locomotion (always counts if present)
if (this.characterData.droidSystems.locomotion) count++;

// Processor (always free Heuristic, but still counts as a system)
if (this.characterData.droidSystems.processor) count++;

// Appendages (all count, including the 2 free hands)
count += this.characterData.droidSystems.appendages.length;

// Accessories
count += this.characterData.droidSystems.accessories.length;
```

### Bug #11: No Validation of Imported Droid Data
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Data Quality
**Location:** `/scripts/apps/chargen/chargen-droid.js:904-910`

**Problem:**
When importing a droid type, there was no validation that the droid had required data:
```javascript
if (droid.system && droid.system.abilities) {
  // ... set abilities
}
// If abilities are missing, silently falls back to defaults
```

If a droid compendium entry had incomplete data, users would get wrong stats with no warning.

**Impact:** Users might not notice imported droids have missing/incorrect stats.

**Fix Applied:**
✅ Added validation warning:
```javascript
// Validate droid data completeness
if (!droid.system || !droid.system.abilities) {
  ui.notifications.warn(`${droid.name} is missing ability data. Using defaults.`);
}
```

## RECOMMENDATIONS 💡

### Short Term (0-1 day)
1. ✅ **Apply all fixes** — All critical bugs fixed and tested
2. ✅ **Test droid builder UI** — Verify all systems display correctly with costs
3. ✅ **Test hand free logic** — Verify 2 free hands work correctly in all scenarios

### Medium Term (1-2 weeks)
1. **Consider Cost Balancing** — The cost formulas use reasonable defaults, but may need tuning based on game testing
2. **Add Cost Display Examples** — Add tooltips showing how cost is calculated (e.g., "Speed 6 × 10 × Size 1 = 60 cr")
3. **Add System Restrictions** — Consider adding validation that droids can't be over-budget during building

### Long Term (ongoing)
1. **Inventory System** — Consider moving accessories to proper Item-based system rather than inline definitions
2. **Droid Template Validation** — Create validation system for droid compendium entries to ensure all required fields
3. **Enhanced Testing** — Add unit tests for cost calculations and free item logic
4. **Documentation** — Create GM guide for droid creation system and cost customization

## Known Limitations

1. **Cost Formula Estimates** — Costs are calculated estimates based on SWSE balance assumptions. If the source material specifies different costs, these should be updated.
2. **Accessory Incomplete** — Accessory list is reasonable but may not match all official droid accessories. This should be validated against the source material.
3. **No Size-Based Cost Adjustment** — Some systems might need size adjustments; currently only applied globally via costFactor.
