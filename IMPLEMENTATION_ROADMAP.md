3. `scripts/calculations/*.js` (all calculation files)
4. `scripts/actors/base/swse-actor-base.js`
5. `index.js` (uncomment TODOs)

### üü° HIGH - Do Second:
1. `scripts/drag-drop/drop-handler.js`

### üü¢ MEDIUM - Do Third:
1. `scripts/automation/combat-automation.js`
2. `scripts/gm-tools/homebrew-manager.js`
3. Chat templates
4. Settings refinement

### üîµ LOW - Polish Later:
1. Tests
2. Documentation
3. Performance optimization
4. Additional features

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start with calculations** - Everything else depends on accurate math
2. **Test frequently** - Launch FoundryVTT after each major change
3. **Use feature branches** - Don't break main
4. **Document as you go** - Future you will thank you
5. **Ask for help** - The FoundryVTT Discord is very helpful

---

## üéØ Next Action

**Your immediate next step:**
1. Open `scripts/data-models/actor-base-model.js`
2. Complete the schema with all ability scores, defenses, skills, etc.
3. Test that it validates properly
4. Move to calculation modules

**Need help?** Review the stub files - they have detailed TODOs for what needs to be done.

---

## üìù Notes

- All stub files have TODO comments marking what needs completion
- Original files backed up to: C:\Users\Owner\Documents\GitHub\foundryvtt-swse\_BACKUP_20251030_195751
- Merged files tracked in: RESTRUCTURE_REPORT.json
- This roadmap is living - update as you complete tasks

**Remember:** This is a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on getting one phase working well before moving to the next.

Good luck! May the Force be with you. üåü
