- **Orientation**: Portrait or square aspect ratio

## Integration

Once images are added to this directory, they will automatically appear on the template selection cards in-game. The templates are already configured in `/data/character-templates.json`.

## Template Card Display

Each image will be displayed on a card that also shows:
- Character name (Worker, Trooper, Criminal, etc.)
- Quote
- Description
- Species
- Starting feat
- Trained skills
- Starting equipment
- Credits

The image serves as the visual backdrop for the card, so it should be visually appealing and representative of the archetype.
